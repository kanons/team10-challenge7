## Description
**What will our app do and what are the main features?**

We plan on implementing a basic polling system. 

Our project will allow users to create new polls, submit answers to polls, 
and visualize poll results through a variety of charts (i.e. bar charts and pie charts).
Charts will be customizable by features such as ascending/descending axes and alphabetical or default sorting.

**Who would use our app?**

Our project would be used by individuals, groups, and organizations who would like quick and basic feedback to informal questions. 
These users would most likely derive from high schools and colleges. 

## Libraries, Frameworks, and APIs 
* Chart.js
* Bootstrap Framework
